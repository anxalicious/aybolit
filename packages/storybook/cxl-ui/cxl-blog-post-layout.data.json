The same year I started a web development and CRO-focused design agency called Markitekt with my co-founder Viljo. Another co-founder, Leho, joined about 2 months later. In 2013 we stopped doing all web development work and focused 100% on conversion optimization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015 I started to think more and more about adding on more scalable business units. As a world class agency we were in the business of expertise, so adding on a training business seemed a logical next step. Our qualitative research &#8211; asking our email subscribers what else would like to buy from us &#8211; confirmed it. Thousands of people said they want it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I put together a new team at the start of 2016, and the first iteration of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/conversionxli.warmpress.com\/\">CXL Institute<\/a>&nbsp;launched in May 2016. The start was rough, and <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hotjar.com\/humans\/how-customer-feedback-saved-cxl\">we almost went out of business<\/a>. One month before running out of money (we&#8217;re bootstrapped, used agency profits) we managed&nbsp;to turn the sinking ship around.&nbsp; All thanks to constant user research and nimble action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2017 was unstable, but profitable. There was little to no predictability for revenue &#8211; monthly income levels varied sometimes over 2x (up and down).<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>2018 summary<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This was a year of learning.&nbsp;2018 is when CXL Institute finally got past its infancy phase and achieved stability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>CXL overall made ~$3.6 million USD<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Institute $1.9 mil USD<ul><li>Institute sales&nbsp;$1.38 mil&nbsp;(<span style=\"color: #339966;\">up 35% over last year<\/span>) <ul><li>75% recurring <a href=\"https:\/\/conversionxli.warmpress.com\/all-access\/\">subscription revenue<\/a><\/li><li>13% <a href=\"https:\/\/conversionxli.warmpress.com\/online-courses\/?_categories=minidegree-programs\">Minidegrees<\/a><\/li><li>12% various one-off <a href=\"https:\/\/conversionxli.warmpress.com\/online-courses\/?_categories=online-trainings\">courses<\/a> <\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>CXL Live conference $556k <\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Agency $1.7 mil USD&nbsp;(<span style=\"color: #339966;\">up 40% over last year<\/span>)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/conversionxli.warmpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/_conversionxli\/2018\/12\/institute-revenue-1024x326.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-954104\" srcset=\"https:\/\/conversionxli.warmpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/_conversionxli\/2018\/12\/institute-revenue-1024x326.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/conversionxli.warmpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/_conversionxli\/2018\/12\/institute-revenue-568x181.jpg 568w, https:\/\/conversionxli.warmpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/_conversionxli\/2018\/12\/institute-revenue-120x38.jpg 120w, https:\/\/conversionxli.warmpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/_conversionxli\/2018\/12\/institute-revenue-300x95.jpg 300w, https:\/\/conversionxli.warmpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/_conversionxli\/2018\/12\/institute-revenue-100x32.jpg 100w, https:\/\/conversionxli.warmpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/_conversionxli\/2018\/12\/institute-revenue.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Monthly revenue is moving in the right direction, but we&#8217;re still only getting started.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: we&#8217;re running CXL agency and CXL Institute as separate legal entities.

We&#8217;re now past the magic 4000 hour watch time mark.<\/li><li>We changed how we handle certificates, and weâ€™ve now started issuing certificates through Accredible. With Accredible our digital certificates act as proof of skill and prove your credibility. Accredible uses a bank-level encryption and blockchain logging verification system to provide secure digital credentials. This allows third parties (like potential employers) to confirm the validity of your certificates.<\/li><li>5456 live chat conversations. Hit us up, we&#8217;re around most of the time!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Team<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CXL as a whole is like 29.5 people + some regular contractors (developers). We got 2 main offices: Tallinn, Estonia and Austin, TX. There are also people remote in London, Vancouver, Westcliffe (Colorado), Gdansk, Budapest and Freetown (Sierra Leone).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Institute<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re 10 full-time people and 3 part-time (shared 50\/50 with our agency).&nbsp;There are 8 full-time people in Austin, 4 folks in Tallinn, 1 in Freetown.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christmas dinner 2018 in Austin:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/conversionxli.warmpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/_conversionxli\/2018\/12\/IMG_20181218_183941-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-953627\" srcset=\"https:\/\/conversionxli.warmpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/_conversionxli\/2018\/12\/IMG_20181218_183941-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/conversionxli.warmpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/_conversionxli\/2018\/12\/IMG_20181218_183941-568x426.jpg 568w, https:\/\/conversionxli.warmpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/_conversionxli\/2018\/12\/IMG_20181218_183941-120x90.jpg 120w, https:\/\/conversionxli.warmpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/_conversionxli\/2018\/12\/IMG_20181218_183941-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/conversionxli.warmpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/_conversionxli\/2018\/12\/IMG_20181218_183941-100x75.jpg 100w, https:\/\/conversionxli.warmpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/_conversionxli\/2018\/12\/IMG_20181218_183941.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We had some people leave and more people join the team in 2018.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of 2018 was without a dedicated content person &#8211; until Derek started in September.&nbsp; That&#8217;s been the longest we&#8217;ve been without (almost a year). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the first couple of years I wrote every blog post myself. Then I got real lucky with our former writers Tommy Walker, Shanelle Mullin and Alex Birkett &#8211; and I figured that finding top calibre content people is easy-peasy. Not so much. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mediocre people are dime a dozen, but top quality people are really hard to find. Actually Derek applied <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/peeplaja\/status\/1012791183859478528\">after I complained on Twitter<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We added a brand new sales team in November &#8211; adding sales as a channel for us (100% self-serve until now). Too early to speak of any results, but it&#8217;s one of the things that I bet is going to be big for us in 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Team composition end of 2018:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Diego &#8211; product manager<\/li><li>Maddie &#8211; customer success<\/li><li>Wade and Kyndall &#8211; growth marketing<\/li><li>Kyle &#8211; video production, video marketing<\/li><li>Derek &#8211; head of content (blog)<\/li><li>Jesan and Matt &#8211; sales<\/li><li>Jaan &#8211; design and conversion optimization&nbsp;(part-time)<\/li><li>Laszlo &#8211; design&nbsp;(part-time)<\/li><li>Gerda &#8211; customer success, Euro\/APAC timezones (part-time)<\/li><li>Leho &#8211; CTO<\/li><li>Peep &#8211; CEO<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We have new people joining in January 2019!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Culture and values<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Business culture is mostly shaped after their founders (at least in the beginning). Founders bring the culture from the life experiences they had &#8211; like Larry Page and Sergey Brin modeled Google&#8217;s early culture after Stanford grad school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think Viljo and I were much influenced by our experience at AIESEC, the international student organization. CXL has always been with a flat hierarchy &#8211; minimal power distance, little supervision with an expectation of proactivity&nbsp;while promoting employee&#8217;s increased involvement in the decision-making process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone that needs a lot of hand-holding and micromanagement will not succeed here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, we finally mapped out our values &#8220;on paper&#8221; and it&#8217;s now a more concious way of operating. Here they are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Caring<\/strong>. We care more. We give a shit. We see people behind numbers. We do what it takes to help our customers achieve their goals. We go the extra mile. We care about each other. We have trust, honesty and respect for each other.<\/li><li><strong>Excellence<\/strong>. Everything we do is high quality. Anything worth doing will take time, attention and planning. If weâ€™re gonna do something, itâ€™s either all-in or we donâ€™t do it. We donâ€™t half-ass it, we always full ass everything.<\/li><li><strong>Learning<\/strong>.&nbsp;Weâ€™re ever-evolving, always striving to become better versions of ourselves. We invest in our growth, we put in the work, we show up. We donâ€™t have dogmas, weâ€™re willing to change our minds and change course in light of new evidence.<\/li><li><strong>Speed<\/strong>. Actions speak louder than words, action now matters even more. We donâ€™t dilly-dally, we decide. Instead of talking about something 10 times, we get into it. Do now rather than later. When you do something, at least then we have something to talk about. We always ask, whatâ€™s the best use of my time right now?<\/li><li><strong>Proactivity<\/strong>.&nbsp;We take responsibility. Weâ€™re change-oriented. Initiative and anticipatory action are king. If we see that something is broken, we fix it. We own it. We have integrity, we do what we say.<\/li><li><strong>Fun<\/strong>.&nbsp;Fun is a serious business at CXL. We make sure weâ€™re enjoying the process while chipping away at the dream. We take breaks to recharge and enjoy the moment.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>One piece of the fun is organizing our 2 conferences per year &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/conversionxl.com\/live\/\">CXL Live<\/a> in Austin and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalelitecamp.com\">Elite Camp<\/a> in Estonia. It&#8217;s when the whole CXL team comes together. We don&#8217;t use any event management companies, it&#8217;s all done by our people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also gets bloody hot in Austin in the summer, so the whole team ships over to Estonia for a month or so (or at least has in the last 2 years). Fun times!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Wanna join our team?&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/conversionxl.com\/jobs\/\">Check our job openings<\/a>.

Not to get promoted. (Fake it till you make it?)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we&#8217;re focused on B2B.  And with businesses, it&#8217;s more complicated than that. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are 3 big problems with training:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Lack of structure<\/li><li>Lack of accountability<\/li><li>Lack of transparency<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe a better way to sum this up is that hardly anyone is learning and nobody cares.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll discuss each issue in more detail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Lack of structure.&nbsp;<\/strong>In most businesses, upskilling of their marketing people is completely unorganized.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of a calculated way to train someone based on where they&#8217;re at, what their role demands of them and what the company growth priorities are, it&#8217;s mostly random.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some cases the direct manager sends someone to a training.&nbsp;Many companies have an annual training budget per employee &#8211; where the employees themselves decide on how to spend it. It&#8217;s mostly spent on attending conferences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conferences are not even close to great places for learning though. Yes, you can totally pick up a thing or three, but it&#8217;s not comparable to actual training products. The main value of conferences is in meeting people, building and cultivating relationships. Some might even meet their future spouses (greetings to Oli and Nicole).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve talked to hundreds of marketing leaders asking them who oversees what people spend their training budget on. Like who in the organization keeps track of all of this, and is interested that people invest in their growth. Know who that person typically is? Nobody!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hear things like this (actual quote from a friend of mine):<\/p><p>Do companies want great results from their marketing teams? Sure! So it&#8217;s kind of mind blowing that this is left to chance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">What companies should do instead is think about their key marketing initiatives and goals&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">â€“ which skills play a critical role here? Then assess your peopleâ€™s&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">skills and identify whatâ€™s missing or could be improved.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Itâ€™s the deep skills that drive most of the success. Hard work doesn&#8217;t matter if you have only mediocre skill sets to match that effort.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another piece of structure that is missing from most companies is dedicated time for learning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to make time for learning. Or to be more precise &#8211; there&#8217;s a perception that it&#8217;s hard to make time for it. The solution is quite simple: allocate regular time for learning on your weekly calendar. What gets scheduled, gets done. Or at least it helps. There are 2 more pieces to this: accountability and transparency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Lack of accountability<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever downloaded or bought an ebook\/course, and looked at it maybe once? Yeah me too. Everyone has.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you had to study at school\/college and you did read the required books. The difference? Accountability. Somebody was expecting you to learn, and report on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This works beautifully in a business setting too. The most effective tool to make sure the team is learning is managerial accountability. If team members have to report every month what they learned and present their learnings (in front of the whole team) along with recommended action steps for the company, learning will get done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Lack of transparency<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Final piece of this puzzle is transparency. Can people &#8211; your manager as well as your peers &#8211; see your learning efforts in real-time? If yes, you&#8217;ll be much more likely to spend time learning and earning those certificates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Public leaderboards and the peer pressure that comes with it are very effective to get people to spend time improving their skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Needless to say &#8211; these are the very issues CXL Institute is focused on: helping companies bring structure to training the marketing team, assist with accountability and transparency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/conversionxli.warmpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/_conversionxli\/2018\/12\/MS-team-roadmap-1024x761.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-953646\" srcset=\"https:\/\/conversionxli.warmpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/_conversionxli\/2018\/12\/MS-team-roadmap-1024x761.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/conversionxli.warmpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/_conversionxli\/2018\/12\/MS-team-roadmap-568x422.jpg 568w, https:\/\/conversionxli.warmpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/_conversionxli\/2018\/12\/MS-team-roadmap-120x89.jpg 120w, https:\/\/conversionxli.warmpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/_conversionxli\/2018\/12\/MS-team-roadmap-300x223.jpg 300w, https:\/\/conversionxli.warmpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/_conversionxli\/2018\/12\/MS-team-roadmap-100x74.jpg 100w, https:\/\/conversionxli.warmpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/_conversionxli\/2018\/12\/MS-team-roadmap.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>CXL Institute&#8230; ah that&#8217;s CRO stuff<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An interesting challenge we have is that people hear CXL and they instantly think our training is only about conversion optimization. That that&#8217;s the only thing. People have pegged us as &#8220;CRO&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s true that CRO is the niche we started in and achieved success in. But now we want to be much more than that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re releasing new training products every single month &#8211; typically 2 new courses per month. We&#8217;re now up to 50 different courses &#8211; all on various aspects of digital marketing. Maybe 30% are related to conversion optimization, but we actually have world class training programs for everyone in a marketing team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s what CXL Instiute is &#8211; training for the WHOLE marketing team.&nbsp;We need to be better at communicating this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Priorities for 2019<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Adding new profitable, scalable acquisition channels<\/strong>. We&#8217;ve been relying on organic search + email marketing as our main channels. To speed up growth, we need to figure out additional channels for growth.<br><br>For 2019 we&#8217;re going to focus on outbound sales (combined with account based marketing) and PPC as next channels we want to figure out.We&#8217;ve been doing PPC, but with mixed results due to our relatively high price point. <br><br>Experimentation with various email capture funnels hasn&#8217;t been fruitful yet. Too many variables, too long email drip sequences. Our early experiments with quiz funnels are promising. We&#8217;ll do more of that. Our upcoming lower cost plans and free trials should help.<\/li><li><strong>Improving our product.&nbsp;<\/strong>We&#8217;re fully aware of various usability issues we have &#8211; and it&#8217;s as frustrating for us as it is for our users. Development is always way slower than we&#8217;d like. Finally, a new in-app experience is almost here. Naturally, continuous optimization follows.<br><br>We&#8217;re also focused on the production quality of our courses. While I stand by the quality of the content for all of it, the production quality of some of them are not good. The reason being is that since the fall of 2016 we produced live online courses &#8211; all live streamed with live instructor Q&amp;A. It was a great way to get started with CXL Institute. .<\/p><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Future: whatâ€™s coming early in 2019?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Branding initiatives.<\/strong> While looking at various players in the online training space, you&#8217;ll notice 2 things: 1) A sea of sameness, and 2) everyone bets almost entirely on&nbsp;&#8220;rational&#8221; arguments in their pitch. Yet, when options look pretty much the same &#8211; we choose based on emotional reasons. Heck, we choose stuff based on emotional reasons most of the time, and then justify it via post-purchase rationalization.<br><br>My background is in direct response marketing, and branding has mostly been an afterthought for me. Of course, you have a brand whether you work on it or not. But I&#8217;ve come around now. I think brand is *very* important.<br><br>We&#8217;ve been conscious about the brand of our blog &#8211; and have had guiding principles for it since the start. Now expect strong branding initiavies and efforts from us for CXL Institute as well.<\/li><li><strong>New look&#8217;n&#8217;feel<\/strong> for both the Institute web app as a well as the marketing site (blog etc). Rolling out in January. The changes are not purely cosmetic, they also include a myriad of usability enhancements and other improvements.<\/li><li><strong>Lower cost subsription plans.<\/strong>&nbsp;Our <a href=\"https:\/\/conversionxli.warmpress.com\/all-access\/\">All-Access plan<\/a> is designed and priced for teams. Many solo individuals want access to our stuff, but can&#8217;t afford it. We&#8217;ve heard you. We&#8217;re rolling out a new subscription plan for solo users at $99\/mo. Coming soon.<\/li><li><strong>Free trials for all our plans.&nbsp;<\/strong>We haven&#8217;t been offering free trials on our website &#8211; well, because our product is content. So it&#8217;s tricky. A lot of leeches and scammers out there. But I know people want it. So we&#8217;re gonna roll out free (credit card) trials. Adding in the credit card required thing for intentional friction (and weeding out people without credit cards).<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>2018 was a solid year for us. We&#8217;re super grateful to all our customers, and we&#8217;ll keep focusing on the value we add. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We learned *a ton*. Many flawed business assumptions were revealed, many new insights for driving the business forward discovered. I personally wanted better results from 2018, but I&#8217;ll take it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We now have a very good idea what we need to do to drive fast growth in 2019. <\/p>\n",
